# investigate-a-dataset

This project was completed while taking the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree course.

In this project, I analyzed the attendance of scheduled medical appointments, and found trends for patients who appeared for their scheduled appointments, and those who did not.

Variables are explored such as region, how early the patient scheduled the appointment, and whether the patient received a reminder, and how these variables affected their attendance.
